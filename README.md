# synonyms
Project complete in ESC180, meant to find the closest synonym through semantic similarity of any pairing of words. The semantic similarity is computed by a semantic descriptor vector of each of the words, and taking the similarity measurement to be a cosine similarity between the two words. By taking large chunks of sentences (such as books), the program can learn the context in which words are said and as such more closely associate two words through the cosine similarity. The theory can be found by searching semantic similarity, or cosine similarity. Thank you to Michael Guerzhoy for the project motivation and theory explanations.
